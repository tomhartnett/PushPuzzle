# PushPuzzle
A [Sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban) style puzzle game. Push boxes to their targets to complete a level. But be careful! You can't _pull_ a box, so one wrong move means you can't beat the level.

*This app was almost entirely "vibe-coded" with Claude Code*

- Written in Swift
- Uses the SpriteKit framework
- Uses level maps I found in this repo (Thank you!): https://github.com/begoon/sokoban-maps 

This was a vibe-coding experiment. I wanted to try out Claude Code and see how it works. I gave Claude prompts and let it write the code. Then I tested the results. With a few exceptions of minor edits, I did not write the code myself.
